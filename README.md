The aim of the project is to simulate a decision - making protocol based on the experiments described in articles already published.

The task includes a robotic arm which has to decide wether throw a ball in a right net or left one, depending on an external indication. 
The robot is able to take the decision thanks to the neural network, which has the following structure:

We start from two excitatory neuronal populations, A and B, with their proper external input stimuli, the populations are able to excite themselves whether their own stimulus is high. The decision making is binary, so just one stimulus at time can be high, the group for which this doesnâ€™t happen is inhibited by a third population, which is composed by inhibitory interneurons. 
 Noise is another typology of external input, it is add in order to create a network coherent with the physiology of the real ones, in fact noise is always present in real neural connections. 
 
Here are shown the raster plots for three different input stimuli: 
* only noise
* only stimulus A
* only stimulus B 

Are also proposed two different codes, one for populations composed by 200 neurons and a second with 50. The codes show some differences in some parameters (epsilon, p_rate) tuning.

 ## NRP platfrom  
The virtual protocol is implemented into the [neurorobotics](https://www.neurorobotics.net/access-the-nrp.html) platform, which allows to set up artificial experiments using robot and brain models.  

The environment setting includes a robotic arm and a camera watching towards a screen, a circle appearing on a screen triggers the decision. 

During the simulation, when no circle is present the network is receiving endogenous noise only, so the two populations appear spiking equally and the robot remains fixed; as soon as the circle appears on the right, population A receives an additional input that enhances its spiking level, while the population B is almost silenced; the robot understands the correct direction and after a while pushes the ball accordingly. 

The same symmetrically occurs if the circle appears on the left. When the circle disappears, the spiking rate of the two populations returns equal and the robot is ready for the next trial.
